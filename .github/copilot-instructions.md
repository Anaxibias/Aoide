# Copilot Instructions for Spectra Python Application

## Project Overview
This is a Python application project called "Spectra". The main entry point is `main.py` and the project follows standard Python project structure with source code in `src/` and tests in `tests/`.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Application entry point
- `src/`: Source code modules
- `tests/`: Unit tests using pytest
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Development Practices
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Follow semantic versioning for releases
- Add appropriate error handling and logging
